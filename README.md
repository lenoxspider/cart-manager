# cart-manager
Cart Manager is a python program that allows users to manage a virtual basket of items through a command-line interface.
This program acts as a simple shopping basket manager that lets users view, add, remove, and check items in their basket using text commands.
How It Works:
- It starts with three default items: apple, banana, and orange.
- Users can type commands to interact with the basket.
- The program runs in a loop until the user types exit.

Commands You Can Use:
- view → Displays the items in the basket.
- add <item> → Adds a new item (e.g., add mango adds mango to the basket).
- remove <item> → Removes an item if it exists (e.g., remove banana).
- check <item> → Checks if an item is in the basket (e.g., check apple).
- exit → Stops the program.
Notes:
- If the item isn’t in the basket when removing or checking, the program tells you.
- If you enter view and the basket is empty, it notifies you.
- It only understands single-word items (e.g., “grapes” works, but “green apple” won’t).
It’s a straightforward tool that helps track items in a shopping cart using simple commands! Let me know if you need any tweaks.
